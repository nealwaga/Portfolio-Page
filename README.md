Hello,

My first ever portfolio page.

I am new to coding and this is basically my first ever personal portfolio, that briefly describes me and showcases my resume so employers would be able to call me up for an interview and hopefully, hire me.

It currently does not require any setup or installation requirements.

There are no bugs or issues that would corrupt your system, so don't worry.

I only managed to use HTML and CSS only, but I managed to do quite a lot with the two so that was really cool and promising.

If you have problrms, questions, ideas or suggestions, please contact me at waganeal@gmail.com
It will be much appreciated.
